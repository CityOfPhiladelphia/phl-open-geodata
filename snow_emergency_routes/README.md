# Snow Emergency Routes

### Summary

From the [Streets Department snow emergency route page](http://www.philadelphiastreets.com/highways/snow/emergency-routes/) 

> When snow accumulations approach emergency status, the Managing Director may declare a snow emergency. Once emergency status is declared, the City's 110 miles of Snow Emergency Routes receive priority. Owners of vehicles and dumpsters must move them to alternate parking spaces so City forces can clear snow from curb-to-curb on the emergency routes. Any vehicle remaining on a Snow Emergency Route during the declared Snow Emergency will be ticketed and towed.
